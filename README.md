# Shell Infotech - Frontend

This project was build with <br />
**Vite | ReactJS | MUI | Redux | AG Grid | Fromik**

## To run the project

• First you need to run the backend: Clone the BE Project https://github.com/ginthozan-v/shell-infotech-assignment-be <br />
• Then inside the project directory, you can run: <br />
• `npm install` <br />
• `npm run start`

• Then clone this frontend project and inside the project directory, you can run: <br />
• `npm install` <br />
• `npm run dev`

## My assumption from the requirement

• **No same employee can work in 2 cafes:** If a userId is assigned to cafe that user can't be assigned to another cafe. <br/>
• **Calculate number of days worked:** The day a user is assigned to a cafe is the Start date.

###### The DB is up on Mongodb cloud.
